# RubiksCube

A Python module for manipulating a 3x3 Rubik's Cube. When a RubiksCube is created, it is already solved. It can be randomized with the scramble function. Included in the module is a small library for finding specific cube pieces by position, color, or at the intersection of certain faces. Also included is an algorithm for solving a scrambled cube by layer.
